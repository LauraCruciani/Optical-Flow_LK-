  ## Edge Detection and Feature Detection

This repository provides Python code for detecting edges in grayscale images. Ã¹

### Overview

This project implements an edge detection method with the following steps:

1. **Convert Image to Grayscale**: Converts the input image to grayscale if it's in RGB format.
2. **Gaussian Smoothing**: Applies Gaussian filters with different sigma values to reduce noise.
3. **Gradient Computation**: Uses convolution to compute image gradients in both x and y directions.
4. **Edge Detection**: Combines gradients to detect edges and applies thresholding to highlight them.
